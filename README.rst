weblate-odoo-component-generator
================================

Generate weblate projects and components for Odoo projects.

These scripts rely on weblate internales and are compatible with weblate 4.3.

Installation
============

On the weblate machine, in the weblate virtualenv, run

`pip install git+https://github.com/acsone/weblate-odoo-component-generator`

Usage
=====

This project provides two scripts. One to generate projects with a first component
pointing to an Odoo addon in git repository. The other one to generate one component
per addon, linked to the repo of the first addon created.

wocg-create-project
-------------------

.. code::

  Usage: wocg-create-project [OPTIONS]

    This program initializes a weblate project based on a git repository.

    The git repository must contain at least one installable addon with a i18n
    directory containing the .pot file, otherwise it does nothing. A first
    component is created for one of these addons, based on the provided
    component template. Subsequent components can be created with wocg-create-
    components.

  Options:
    --repository TEXT           Ssh url to git repository.  [required]
    --branch TEXT               Target branch.  [required]
    --tmpl-component-slug TEXT  Slug identifier for the template component.
                                [required]
    --addons-subdirectory TEXT  Addons subdirectory, in case addons are not at
                                the root of the project (eg odoo/addons).
    --help                      Show this message and exit.

wocg-create-components
----------------------

.. code::

  Usage: wocg-create-components [OPTIONS]

    This program creates the missing components for all existing Odoo projects
    in Weblate. A component will be created only if the related addon is
    installable and contains a .pot file.

    The projects must have been created before running this programe, as well
    as a first component for each  project in order to provide vcs
    information. Subsequent components are linked to the vcs of the first
    component.

  Options:
    --help  Show this message and exit.
